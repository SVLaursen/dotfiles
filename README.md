# Dotfiles

My personal dotfiles!

## My Setup

My very "original" development setup consisting of the following elements:

- Homebrew
- Alacritty
- Neovim
- Tmux
- SKHD
- Yabai
- Zsh
- Oh-My-Zsh
- Zoxide
- Ripgrep
- Exa
- Bat
- Navi

## Dependencies

For my Neovim configuration there are a couple of dependencies that needs to be installed prior to use.

I make use of a Markdown previewer called Peek.nvim which uses Deno to boot up the preview window.
Without Deno the command will not succeed however the rest of the editor should still work.

For a more detailed description of the dependencies and how to load in the Neovim config, check out my Neovim Config repository.
